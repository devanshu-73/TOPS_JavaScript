Cookies are data, stored in small text files, on your computer.

When a web server has sent a web page to a browser, the connection is shut down,
and the server forgets everything about the user.
Cookies were invented to solve the problem "how to remember information about the user":

When a user visits a web page, his/her name can be stored in a cookie.
Next time the user visits the page, the cookie "remembers" his/her name.
Cookies are saved in name-value pairs like:

username = John Doe
document.cookie = "username=John Doe";

	
You can also add an expiry date (in UTC time). By default, the cookie is deleted when the browser is closed:

document.cookie = "username=John Doe; expires=Thu, 18 Dec 2013 12:00:00 UTC";


Delete a Cookie with JavaScript

Just set the expires parameter to a past date:

document.cookie = "username=; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 UTC; path=/;";

	alert(document.cookie);	
}
